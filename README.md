# Kickstarter_Challenge

## Overview of Project
This project is being used to identify two relationships. The first relationship we investigate is to show the relationship between *theatre's outcomes based on launch dates* and the second one is to show the relationship between *play outcomes based on goals.*

### Purpose
**This project will mainly highligh and bring out the key factors for the differences of the two investigations and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.**

## Analysis and Challenges
In this sections we will talk about the **analysis and challenges** faced when these individual experiments were conducted. 

Firstly here we will consider the what additional conversions and column additions were done to the ***Kickstarter*** excel file. So, we see that the *"launched_at"* column is supposed to be showing dates but has in under *Unix Based* time format. Therefore we created a ***"Date Created Conversion"*** column to show the actual date format and the seperated the years using the ***year*** function on excel. After the creation of these preceding columns we could see trend of theatre over a period of 9 years. A pivot table was created with main criteria being considered successful, failed and cancelled for theatre outcomes over the specific time period. In the end we created a line chart to bring this trend to a visualization perspective.

The second experiment and analysis was performed to derive the results onhow the *outcomes varied when placed against goals for plays.* We started of by taking several date ranges with diffrences of the amount 4999, starting from **"<1000"** ending to the being **">50000"**.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
